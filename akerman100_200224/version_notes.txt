FINE TUNE:
_ scrubber Length
    - possible to set max value and make it proportional to how long
    delay length would be?

_ rippleX and rippleY are set to center, not mouse click setting it

_ "Box" ripple doesn't work

NOTE:
_ using older library to work with SVG




TO DO:
+ DON"T DRAW THE SHAPE, DRAW THE IMAGE!
Don't worry about individual points; draw the graphic and then repeat in the rotations
Draw image and rotate that, not a beginShape() with graphics

OR!

Switch to just lerping the color and drawing lines between two extremes
